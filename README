## 🎮 Overview

This project demonstrates how modern games use **Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment (DDA)** to create personalized gaming experiences. The game continuously monitors player performance metrics and uses a trained Random Forest model to predict reaction times and adjust difficulty accordingly.

### Key Features

- **Real-time ML Predictions**: Predicts player's next reaction time using performance data
- **Adaptive Difficulty**: Automatically adjusts target size, speed, and movement patterns
- **Performance Tracking**: Monitors accuracy, reaction time, streaks, and combos
- **Visual Feedback**: Dynamic effects for hits, misses, and score multipliers
- **Smooth Gameplay**: 60 FPS with physics-based target movement

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip package manager

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/kotgire58/Building-VENV.git
cd Building-VENV
```

2. **Install required packages**
```bash
pip install requirements.txt
```

3. **Train the ML model**
```bash
python train.py
```

4. **Run the game**
```bash
python adaptive_click_game.py
```

## 🧠 How It Works

### Machine Learning Pipeline

1. **Data Generation**: The training script generates 5,000 synthetic gameplay samples simulating various skill levels
2. **Feature Engineering**: Creates 18 features including:
   - Performance metrics (accuracy, reaction time, streaks)
   - Game state (target size, speed, difficulty level)
   - Derived features (hit/miss ratios, performance consistency)
3. **Model Training**: Random Forest Regressor predicts expected reaction time
4. **Real-time Inference**: Game adjusts difficulty based on predicted vs actual performance

### Difficulty Adjustment Logic

```python
if performance_ratio < 0.8:  # Player performing better than expected
    difficulty_level += 0.05  # Increase difficulty
elif performance_ratio > 1.2:  # Player struggling
    difficulty_level -= 0.05  # Decrease difficulty
```

## 🎯 Gameplay

### Controls
- **Left Click**: Hit the target
- **Space**: Pause/Resume
- **Escape**: Exit game

### Scoring System
- **Base Points**: Calculated from accuracy and speed
- **Combo Multiplier**: Increases with consecutive hits
- **Difficulty Bonus**: Higher difficulty = more points

### Performance Metrics
- **Accuracy**: Percentage of successful hits
- **Reaction Time**: Time between target appearances and clicks
- **Streak**: Consecutive successful hits
- **Combo Multiplier**: 1 + (streak / 10)
