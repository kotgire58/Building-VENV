Adaptive Difficulty ML Game
A Machine Learning Powered Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment (DDA) System

This project demonstrates a real-time adaptive difficulty system using machine learning.
The player clicks a moving target, while the game continuously measures performance and uses a trained Random Forest Regressor to predict expected reaction time.

Based on this prediction, the game automatically adjusts difficulty by modifying:

Target size

Movement speed

Velocity randomness

Scoring difficulty

This creates a personalized gameplay experience similar to systems used in modern AAA games.
